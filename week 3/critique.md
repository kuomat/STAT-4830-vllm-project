## Strengths
- Clear optimization statement and success metrics defined for a relatively open-ended problem
- Thorough discussion of possible limitations and challenges, including consideration of both user-facing (data privacy), efficiency (latency), algorithmic (metadata mismatch), and conceptual (cold-start with 0 history on other sites) issues.

## Weaknesses
- Resource Requirements: We need GPUs beyond Google Colab's free-tier but can't specify the exact GPU types or hours required until we finalize the model size and data.
- Scalability and Latency: Scalability and latency are crucial, but we haven't addressed how the model will scale or minimize latency yet, as this depends on the finalized data.

## Critical Risks/Assumptions:
- Assuming the dataset will fit in memory but we need to test this once we finalize our dataset.
- Assuming that we will be able to solve this problem with GraphSAGE but we might need to find bigger models.

## Concrete Next Actions
- Create and find usable datasets to train our recommendation system
  - Find a comprehensive collection of images (starting with clothing items)
  - Look for existing datasets of images
- Research and explore more clustering algorithms that better suit this problem

## Resource Needs
- Need to learn how the GraphSAGE model works conceptually and how to implement it in our web extension context. Will browse the GraphSAGE PyTorch docs in detail and follow online tutorial notebooks.
- Need to learn about the best ways to embed our graph model so we can get results that are as accurate as possible.
