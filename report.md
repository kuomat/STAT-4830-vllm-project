## Problem Statement  

We aim to optimize personalized recommendations for users when they visit a new e-commerce website where they have minimal prior purchase history.  
Cold-start issues in recommendation systems lead to poor user experience, making it difficult for users to receive relevant suggestions when they switch to a new platform. This can cause frustration, reduce engagement, and limit conversions for businesses.  

### Success Metrics  
- **Recommendation Relevance**: Precision@k, Recall@k, and NDCG to evaluate how well our recommendations match user interests.  
- **User Engagement**: Click-through rate (CTR) on recommended products.  

### Constraints  
- **Data Availability**: Not all websites expose metadata in the same format (e.g., missing product descriptions, different image qualities).  
- **Real-Time Performance**: The web extension must generate recommendations quickly without excessive computational overhead.  
- **User Privacy**: Ensuring ethical data usage without tracking sensitive information.  

### Required Data  
- **User interactions** from shopping sites (order history, wish lists, browsing activity).  
- **Product metadata** (titles, descriptions, images, categories, prices, brands) across multiple websites.  
- **User-generated content** (ratings, reviews, preferences) from different platforms.  

### Potential Pitfalls  
- **Sparse shopping history from other sites**: Recommendations may be weak.  
- **Metadata Mismatch**: Makes standardization potentially difficult.  
- **Scale**: Large product graphs may introduce latency in recommendations.  
- **Privacy Concerns**: Tracking user activity across websites must comply with data protection regulations.
