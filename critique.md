## Weaknesses

### Resource Requirements Could Be More Specific
For this part, we mentioned that we need GPUs beyond the free-tier GPUs that Google Colab provides, but we could have dug deeper into whether we need specific GPUs and how many GPU hours we will need to complete the project. However, at this point in time, we don’t have an idea of how large our model is going to be and are in the process of collecting more data points, so we are unable to give a specific number in terms of how many GPU hours we will need and what types of GPUs we require.

### Scalability and Latency Considerations 
Since we are building a machine learning model, we will need a lot of data, and therefore scalability and latency will be very important. In this report, we didn’t really address how the model will scale as the graph grows or how latency will be minimized when generating recommendations, as we still need to look more into this after we finalize our data.
